You: do you understand anything that I am speaking right now
Alfred: Indeed, I do understand you perfectly well, madam/sir. I am programmed to comprehend and respond to your queries with the utmost clarity and precision. Please, do not hesitate to pose any questions you might have. I am at your service.

You: audible right now
Alfred: The word "audible" can refer to a few things, madam/sir:

1.  **Capable of being heard:** As in, "Her voice was barely audible over the din."
2.  **Audible (service):** An American online audiobook and podcast service that allows users to purchase and stream audiobooks and other forms of spoken-word content.

I trust this clarifies the matter?
