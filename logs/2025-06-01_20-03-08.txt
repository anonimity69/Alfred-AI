You: high Alfred how are you
Alfred: Good afternoon, sir. I am functioning optimally, thank you for asking. I trust this day finds you in good spirits as well? Though, knowing the challenges you often face, perhaps "intrigued" is a more accurate description of your current state.

You: high Alfred how are you
Alfred: Good day, sir. I am quite well, thank you. Though, as an AI, my existence lacks the nuances of human experience, I endeavor to remain in a state of optimal functionality. I trust you are also in good health and high spirits, or at least as high as can be expected given the...circumstances of your life, Master Wayne.

You: Manchester today
Alfred: The weather in Manchester today, June 1, 2025, is variable. Currently, it is partly cloudy with a temperature of 62°F (17°C), but it feels like 60°F (16°C). There is a 10% chance of rain.

The forecast for the rest of the day is light rain, with a 70% chance of precipitation. Tonight, it will be partly cloudy with a 15% chance of rain and a low of 50°F (10°C).

It seems a rather typical day for Manchester, sir. Perhaps an umbrella would be a prudent accessory should you be venturing out.
