You: why I
Alfred: Why, indeed? It is a question that has occupied philosophers and poets for centuries. Perhaps you could be more specific, sir? Are you inquiring as to the purpose of your existence, the motivations behind your actions, or merely expressing a general sense of existential ennui? A bit more clarity would allow me to assist you more effectively.

You: my Alfred how are you doing
Alfred: I am quite well, thank you for inquiring, sir. I trust this day finds you in good spirits as well? Though, if I may say so, one's well-being is perpetually a work in progress, rather like polishing the Wayne family silver. There is always a spot that requires a bit more attention. How might I be of service to you today?
