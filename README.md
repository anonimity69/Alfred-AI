## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anonimity69/Alfred-AI.git
cd Alfred-AI

🧩 How It Works
Press and hold the 🎙️ Hold to Talk button.

Speak naturally. Alfred records continuously until you release the button.

Audio is sent to the Speech-to-Text module to transcribe your speech.

Transcription is fed into the AlfredChatbot for generating a response.

Response is converted to speech using the Text-to-Speech engine.

The audio response plays back automatically.

Your conversation is logged with timestamps for review.
